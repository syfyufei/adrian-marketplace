# LLM Research Marketplace

LLM Research Marketplace is a curated collection of three independent Claude Code skills: `research-memory`, `project-management`, and `skill-squared`. Instead of a single large plugin, this repository acts as a marketplace, allowing you to install only the skills you need.

## Marketplace Snapshot

| Skill | Version | Purpose | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| research-memory | 0.2.0 | Academic research memory management | 10 |
| project-management | 0.1.0 | Standardized project scaffolding & validation | 4 |
| skill-squared | 0.1.0 | Skill creation, extension, and validation | 4 |

Total commands available: **18**

## Installation

First, add the repository as a new marketplace. You can do this by running the local script or by adding it manually within Claude Code.

**Option A: Run the script**
```bash
./install.sh
```
This will add the local directory as a marketplace named `LLM-Research-Marketplace`.

**Option B: Manual Install**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/syfyufei/llm-research-marketplace
```

### Install Individual Skills

Once the marketplace is added, you can search for and install the skills you want:

```bash
# See what's available
/plugin marketplace search LLM-Research-Marketplace

# Install one or more skills
/plugin install research-memory@LLM-Research-Marketplace
/plugin install project-management@LLM-Research-Marketplace
/plugin install skill-squared@LLM-Research-Marketplace
```

### Verify Installation

Check your installed plugins:
```bash
/plugin list
```
If you installed all three, the output should show `research-memory`, `project-management`, and `skill-squared`.

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Install the skills you need** – See the Installation section above.
2. **Create a project workspace** – `/project-management:create` scaffolds directories and templates.
3. **Track research progress** – `/research-memory:bootstrap` and `/research-memory:remember` manage development logs.
4. **Build new skills** – `/skill-squared:create` scaffolds a new, standalone Claude Code skill.

## Directory Layout

The repository is now structured as a marketplace containing multiple plugins.

## Management Commands

Manage each skill individually.

```bash
# List installed plugins
/plugin list

# Update a specific skill to its latest version
/plugin update research-memory

# Remove a skill you no longer need
/plugin uninstall project-management
```

## Development Notes

- Source repositories remain available for deep development:
  - `/Users/adriansun/Documents/GitHub/research-memory`
  - `/Users/adriansun/Documents/GitHub/project-management`
  - `/Users/adriansun/Documents/GitHub/skill-squared`
- Sync changes from standalone repos into this marketplace with `/skill-squared:sync` to keep skills up-to-date.

## Migration from v2.x (Unified Plugin)

If you previously installed the unified "llm-research" plugin version 2.x:

1. **Uninstall the old plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin uninstall llm-research
   ```

2. **Update to v3.x** (independent plugins):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/llm-research-marketplace
   git pull
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Install the plugins you need**:
   ```bash
   # You can now install plugins individually or all three:
   /plugin install research-memory@LLM-Research-Marketplace
   /plugin install project-management@LLM-Research-Marketplace
   /plugin install skill-squared@LLM-Research-Marketplace
   ```

4. **Verify the new structure**:
   ```bash
   /plugin list       # Should show 3 separate plugins
   /help              # Should show 18 commands (or fewer if you installed selectively)
   ```

### What Changed in v3.x

- **Independent Plugins**: Each skill is now a fully self-contained plugin that can be installed/uninstalled separately
- **Plugin-Local Resources**: Templates and configuration files are bundled within each plugin instead of shared at the marketplace root
- **Better Isolation**: Plugins no longer depend on shared resources, making them truly installable as independent units
- **Selective Installation**: You can now install only the plugins you need instead of getting all features
